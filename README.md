This is a minimalistic example to illustrate how you can interactive with smart contract by browser.

# Requirements

Vscode

# Quickstart

1. Clone the repo

```
git clone https://github.com/lightrao/html-fund-me-f24
cd html-fund-me-f24
```

2. Run the file.

You can usually just double click the file to "run it in the browser". Or you can right click the file in your VSCode and run "open with live server".

And you should see a small button that says "connect".
